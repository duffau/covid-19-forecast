# Forecasting COVID-19 cases

Attempt to forecast the number of cases of COVID-19 around the world using the simple SIR model.

## Forecasts
*Updated: 20-03-2020*

Forecasts are based on the simple [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model) which assumes
an individual can be in one of three states,

- Susceptible: Part of the population not immune to the disease, 
- Infected: Is currently infected,
- Removed: Is immune after a recovery or death.

The model is governed by two parameters, the rate at which individuals contract the disease ùõΩ (beta), and the rate at which they are removed from the infected group ùõæ (gamma). 

Data is downloaded from *Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering* COVID-19 [data repository](](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)), used by their
